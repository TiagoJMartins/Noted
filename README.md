# Noted

**_This application does not use full REST capability. There are some bad practices in here. The point of this app was to create it and make it work, not follow every good practice out there. This kind of application would never be put into production as-is._**

This is a very simple (and very visually ugly), note taking application or to-do list.  
I created this application as practice for front and back-end development.  
It uses MongoDB as a database and only has simple CRUD functionality.
